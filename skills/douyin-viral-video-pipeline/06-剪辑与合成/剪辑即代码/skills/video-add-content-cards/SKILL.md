# Video Add Content Cards

Turn approved semantic moments into one coherent HyperFrames graphics overlay. Use shared evidence and the canonical timeline; do not re-transcribe or re-analyze the source inside this skill.

## Dependencies

`/video-understand` is a prerequisite. Run it first so cards use validated
semantic evidence and the canonical timeline.
Before starting, verify that it is installed. If it is not, warn the user that
this prerequisite is missing and stop before processing media.

Require `ffmpeg` on PATH, Python, and Node.js >= 22 (for `npx hyperframes`, fetched on demand). `hyperframes render`/`snapshot` drives a headless Chrome — it manages its own `chrome-headless-shell`, and falls back to a system Chrome (set `CHROME` to override) when the cached one is unusable. Check these before processing media.

## Inputs

- `work/project.json`: operation revisions and dependencies
- `work/understand/understanding.json`: reviewed semantic moments and evidence
- `work/timeline.json`: source-to-program mapping, or an identity timeline when no cut exists
- optional selected color-grade revision when contrast or palette is judged against that look

The skill is valid without a cut or color grade. When captions are active, run them first,
depend on their current revision, and treat their occupied region as a hard exclusion zone.
Content cards must precede graphic motion whenever both are active. These relative rules apply
to every selected pair. Declare only dependencies actually consumed and record their current
revisions in `based_on`.

Treat the visible face and head silhouette of every primary or foreground person, speaker,
presenter, interviewee, or semantically important person as a hard exclusion zone throughout
the complete card cue, including entrances and exits. An incidental background-only person
who is not a narrative or visual focus is exempt; protect uncertain cases. If a card intersects
a protected face or head, reposition it first, then scale or redesign it. Skip the card when no
compliant placement exists.

## Working Files

```

The reusable review page is committed at
`skills/video-add-content-cards/assets/content-cards-review.html`.
The populated HTML, screenshots, overlay, and preview renders are reproducible.
Keep the plan outside `cache/`. It must contain every visible string, timing, placement,
visual-treatment value, renderer composition path, renderer asset path, and source FPS needed
to regenerate the disposable HTML and alpha assets after deleting `work/cache/`. Record one
plan-level `renderer_recipe` with the source example/template, composition output path, render
engine, and every local runtime asset's output path, exact version, origin, and SHA-256. A
cached HTML file or downloaded script with no durable recipe does not satisfy regeneration.

## Workflow

### 1. Interview before drafting

Read `understanding.json` and the active timeline first. Count eligible graphic moments and
calculate the target card count recommendation before interviewing:

```text
min(eligible moments, max(1, round(program minutes / 0.75)))
```

This is a target, not an automatic truncation rule. Before asking any question, open the real
animated examples yourself with the native command for the current OS. Run exactly one:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Start-Process (Resolve-Path 'skills/video-add-content-cards/examples/gallery-animated.html')
```

```bash
# macOS
open skills/video-add-content-cards/examples/gallery-animated.html

# Linux desktop
xdg-open skills/video-add-content-cards/examples/gallery-animated.html
```

If the command fails, diagnose and retry it. Do not replace this action with a URI or ask the
user to find and click the file. The gallery compares all six themes and can focus one column
with its native picker:

| Theme | Starting character |
|---|---|
| `almanac` | warm cream, serif, considered |
| `teal` | dark broadcast, cyan accent |
| `editorial` | documentary, ink and amber |
| `dotgrid` | pixel-mono, technical |
| `apex` | high-energy sports, red accent |
| `air` | transparent Lexend typography, no backing plates or scrims |

Ask exactly one question at a time in this order:

1. Which theme should this edit use?
2. What target card count should this edit use? Offer the calculated recommendation as default.
3. Which card types must be included? Offer `intro`, `key-quote`, `stat`, `list`, and `outro`;
   default to none.

**Present + STOP** after each question. After the third answer, summarize the theme, target
count, required types, and any user-supplied notes; ask for confirmation. If the user cancels,
retain analysis, leave the operation `draft`, and do not author or render cards.

### 2. Draft cards from shared understanding

```powershell
python skills/video-add-content-cards/scripts/build_cards_plan.py `
  work/understand/understanding.json `
  work/timeline.json `
  work/content-cards/cards-plan.json `
  --target-card-count 6 `
  --theme editorial `
  --must-include-type stat `
  --notes "Keep product names verbatim"
```

The script maps kept semantic moments into program time and omits moments removed by the cut. It
preserves source ranges and evidence references, clamps duration to the containing clip, and
marks copy/placement/visual treatment as `draft`. A `stat` starts with `metric-spotlight`; a
`list` starts with `side-by-side`; the candidate review can retain the normal layout or switch
a list to `parallel-columns`.
The confirmed interview is stored as `brief` in `cards-plan.json`. Repeat
`--must-include-type` for multiple values; omit flags that do not apply. Older optional brief
fields remain accepted for compatibility but are not part of the normal interview.

### 3. Make editorial choices

Read the evidence at each card time. Correct ASR names and numbers, prune weak candidates, write concise copy, choose placement that clears protected faces, visible head silhouettes, and captions, and approve the visual treatment. Never treat analyzer text as final copy.

Store all on-screen copy under `copy.display` (for example `eyebrow`, `title`, and `detail`),
not only a summary or suggested title. Set `placement.face_clearance` to `verified` only after
reviewing a composited still against the protected face-and-head definition above, and store
that still's protocol-relative path in
`placement.review_still`. Store the HyperFrames composition, alpha asset, and exact rational
FPS under `renderer`.

Use these mappings as a starting point:

| Semantic kind | Card type |
|---|---|
| hook | intro |
| key-point, quote, question | key-quote |
| stat | stat |
| list | list |
| cta | outro |

`repetition`, `tangent`, and `risk` are editorial evidence, not automatic cards.

Keep the five canonical card types. Store the following optional layouts under
`visual_treatment.layout` rather than creating new top-level card types:

| Canonical card type | Allowed layout |
|---|---|
| `stat` | `default`, `metric-spotlight`, `bar-chart`, `pie-chart`, `line-chart` |
| `list` | `default`, `side-by-side`, `parallel-columns` |

Use `metric-spotlight` only when one evidence-backed number, percentage, amount, multiple,
year, or duration deserves emphasis. Put the number between concise upper and lower context,
fit long values without overlap, and keep the number visually centered between those labels.
Use `side-by-side` or `parallel-columns` for two to four short parallel, contrasting, opposing,
or corresponding concepts. Prefer short phrases; use the review to choose the orientation that
fits the available footage and clears the subject.

Use a chart only when the retained transcript provides a complete, evidence-backed data set.
Read `reference/chart-data.md` before authoring chart data. Manually store the dimension,
metric, unit, period, ordered points, and each point's transcript evidence under `data`; never
infer values from an analyzer summary or combine points from different videos. Use `bar-chart`
for 2-6 comparable categories, `pie-chart` for 2-6 mutually exclusive parts of a proven whole,
and `line-chart` for 3-8 meaningfully ordered points. When required values, labels, a denominator,
time order, or units are missing, use `metric-spotlight`, a normal stat card, or no card.
For chart layouts, compress long explanations into concise supporting copy without changing
their meaning. The chart should primarily communicate the key values and their change or
relationship. Do not enumerate or restate values, labels, periods, or units already visible in
the chart.

Keep all evidence-backed candidates at this stage. Aim for the brief's target card count, but
allow a stronger or sparser set when the evidence warrants it.

### 4. Review and apply candidate choices

Generate a project-specific browser review after the candidate plan exists. Pass the source
video aligned to the plan's `source_range` and the active timeline. The script clamps each
evidence midpoint to its containing retained clip, then populates the committed template with
one corresponding source frame per candidate:

```powershell
python skills/video-add-content-cards/scripts/build_review_page.py `
  work/content-cards/cards-plan.json `
  review/03-content-cards/content-cards-review.html `
  --video input/source.mp4 `
  --timeline work/timeline.json `
  --captions-plan work/captions/captions-plan.json
```

Omit `--captions-plan` when the project has no active captions operation. With an active
captions plan, the review frame shows its actual occupied top, center, or bottom regions.

Immediately open the populated review yourself with the native command for the current OS.
Run exactly one:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Start-Process (Resolve-Path 'review/03-content-cards/content-cards-review.html')
```

```bash
# macOS
open review/03-content-cards/content-cards-review.html

# Linux desktop
xdg-open review/03-content-cards/content-cards-review.html
```

If the command fails, diagnose and retry it; do not ask the user to locate the file. The page
shows each source frame, card ID, program time, editable copy, visual treatment, and placement.
Chart layouts also show editable structured data and the point evidence references. Review
every value against its displayed evidence before approving it.
Every candidate
starts unselected with placement set to `bottom`. Changing placement moves a gray card proxy
over the real frame so collision risk is visible before approval. The user selects cards,
edits copy, chooses treatment and placement, clicks **Copy summary**, and pastes the visible
summary back
into the conversation.

**Present + STOP.** Wait for the pasted selection summary. Do not author HTML from unchecked
draft candidates. Convert the summary into
`review/03-content-cards/content-cards-review.json`: write one entry for every plan card, mark
summary IDs selected with their chosen copy, visual treatment, and placement, and mark all
other IDs unselected with their current draft copy and an empty placement. Store the review
choice as a string field named `visual_treatment`. Then apply the validated review:

```powershell
python skills/video-add-content-cards/scripts/apply_cards_review.py `
  work/content-cards/cards-plan.json `
  review/03-content-cards/content-cards-review.json
```

The apply step rejects unknown, duplicate, or missing card IDs, blank selected copy, invalid
placement, and treatments incompatible with the canonical card type without changing the plan. On success it keeps selected cards and marks
their copy, placement, visual treatment, and top-level review `approved`. Read the resulting
selected count against the brief target before continuing.

For selected chart layouts the apply step also validates the complete structured data and marks
`data.status` approved. Any invalid selected chart rejects the whole review before the plan is
copied. Choosing a non-chart layout removes unused draft chart data. After apply, face and
caption clearance remain pending until the composition is checked against real composited frames.

### 5. Author one HyperFrames composition

Use one `index.html` and a paused GSAP timeline. Each approved card becomes one `.clip` keyed by the plan's `program_start_s` and `duration_s`. Keep motion seek-safe and derive timing from data attributes rather than wall-clock timers.

For chart cues, animate only through that paused timeline at absolute composition times. Bars
reveal from one zero baseline; pie sectors reveal in point order with geometry proportional to
values; line paths draw in X-axis order before their points appear. Use source-relative sizing
and fixed layout boxes so seeking, labels, and dynamic values never cause layout jumps. Suggested
durations are 5-6 seconds for bar and pie and 6-8 seconds for line, always clamped to the retained
clip.

Start from the closest repository example:

- `examples/index-almanac.html`
- `examples/index-apex.html`
- `examples/index-dotgrid.html`
- `examples/index-editorial.html`
- `examples/index-teal.html`
- `examples/index-air.html`

Keep one visual language across all cards, use source-relative sizing, and maintain enough
contrast against the selected grade. The five opaque-panel themes may use a card or scrim for
legibility. `air` must keep scene and text containers transparent: no solid or translucent
backing rectangles, pills, local color blocks, decorative color bars, or full-frame scrims.
Use white for primary text and light gray for auxiliary small text. It may use Lexend weight,
text shadow, a thin outline, spacing, and alignment, but no decorative rules, dots, or filled
geometric accents. Do not cover the speaker or captions.

Pass the source FPS explicitly; preserve fractional rates such as `24000/1001` rather than
rounding to 24 or 30. On Windows use `npx.cmd`, a project-local npm cache, and local assets:

```powershell
$env:npm_config_cache = "$PWD/work/cache/npm"
npx.cmd hyperframes check
```

Do not depend on remote fonts, images, scripts, or styles at render time. For `air`, copy
`assets/fonts/Lexend-VariableFont_wght.ttf` into the project composition assets and record its
output path and SHA-256 in `renderer_recipe` like every other runtime asset.

The approved plan must preserve the exact style and motion values used by the composition,
not prose labels such as `edge-slide` alone. At minimum record panel geometry and padding,
colors, borders, type sizes/weights/line heights, and the enter/rule/text/exit durations,
offsets, staggers, and easing. This makes the creative HTML reproducible from the plan rather
than a hidden decision stored only in disposable cache.

### 6. Review small artifacts

Capture a still near the middle of every cue by compositing the card over the actual base-video
frame at that timestamp, with the approved caption overlay composited first when active.
Transparent-only HyperFrames screenshots prove alpha, not face
clearance, and are insufficient for approval. Also inspect a short composited motion window
whenever an entrance, exit, or moving element approaches a protected face or head. Reposition
the card before approval if any frame intersects the protected region. Do not render a full
preview by default.

Check:

- copy is true to its `evidence_ref`;
- source and program times map correctly;
- text is legible and fits;
- for chart cues, key values and their change remain the primary visual message, and supporting copy does not restate the plotted data set;
- the approved visual treatment matches the canonical card type;
- `air` has no backing plate, decorative rule, filled geometric accent, or full-frame scrim;
- `air` uses white primary text and light-gray auxiliary text;
- protected faces, visible head silhouettes, and captions remain clear throughout the cue;
- animation lands on the spoken phrase;
- alpha is transparent outside card regions.

**Present + STOP.** Show the card stills and any short motion windows, name the card IDs, and
wait for approval. Do not render the full overlay while copy, placement, or timing is disputed.

Every approved cue must have a matching composited still in
`review/03-content-cards/card-stills/`, `face_clearance: "verified"`, and the still path in
the plan. Record the review result in `review/03-content-cards/content-cards-summary.md`.

Clearance happens after the user has selected cards and their initial placements. Sampling the
cue near its start, middle, and end, plus any frame where the speaker moves materially, is the
minimum evidence gate. Final approval still requires the complete cue to remain unobstructed. Set
`face_clearance: "verified"` only when the face outline, eyes, nose, mouth, and expression area
remain unobstructed. With active captions, use stills containing the real rendered caption
overlay and set `caption_clearance: "verified"`; without active captions use
`caption_clearance: "not-applicable"`. Save the composited still path, decision mode, and a
non-empty rationale. If any sampled frame collides, first move the card, then reduce its area or
label density, then choose another layout; remove the card if no safe result exists. Never hide,
move, rewrite, or reduce the readability of captions to make a card fit.

### 7. Render the transparent contribution

Prefer one short alpha MOV per cue so a few seconds of graphics do not create a full-program
transparent video. Render each at the source dimensions and exact source FPS, then declare a
render contribution with its program-time window. A single full-length sparse overlay remains
valid only when it is demonstrably smaller or required by the composition.

Record this operation contribution in `project.json`. Insert `content-cards` after
`captions` and before `graphic-motion`; include `captions` in `depends_on`/`based_on`
when it is active:

```json
{
"target": {"sequence": "main", "scope": "graphics"},
"effects": {
  "changes_timeline": false,
  "changes_geometry": false,
  "changes_video_pixels": false,
  "changes_audio": false,
  "adds_track": "graphics"
},
"check": {
  "status": "pass",
  "report": "../review/03-content-cards/content-cards-summary.md"
},
"render": [
  {
    "kind": "overlay",
    "asset": "cache/content-cards/card-001.mov",
    "start_s": 12.5,
    "duration_s": 4.0
  }
]
}
```

The shared renderer offsets each short clip to `start_s`, limits it to `duration_s`, and
composites it after base-video grading. Keep the operation's `outputs` and each card's
`renderer.asset` consistent with these declared assets.

Set the operation to `approved` or `verified` only after card review and update its integer `revision` when the plan, timing, or selected input changes. The shared renderer performs the final composite after all active operations pass `based_on` checks:

```powershell
python skills/video-understand/scripts/build_render_plan.py .
python skills/video-understand/scripts/render_project.py work/render/render-plan.json
```

## Combining With Captions

Treat captions and cards as separate overlay contributions. Captions are upstream and their
occupied region is unavailable to cards. Resolve placement conflicts before rendering, then
composite them in declared sequence in the shared delivery pass. Move cards to another safe area
when they would occupy the caption region; never cover or displace subtitles.

When captions and cards are both being added, preserve the human gates in this order. First,
finish the captions preset review and its existing **Present + STOP**. Then run the content-card
candidate review and its **Present + STOP** so the user approves cards and chooses their initial
positions. Only after that selection does the Agent author the combined composition and perform
face/caption clearance. The later composited-still review remains required and presents the
clearance evidence for final approval.
