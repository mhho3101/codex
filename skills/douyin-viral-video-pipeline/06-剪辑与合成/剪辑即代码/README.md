  <strong>The open skill stack for agentic video editing.</strong>
</p>

**Cut-as-code** turns video editing into an inspectable, code-driven workflow you can drive with AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw. The agent proposes and records editing decisions as readable files; you review them in browser pages and template galleries, approve the work, and then render the final videos — all free, open source (MIT), and with nothing uploaded to a cloud service.

- ✂️ **Cut** — reviewed keep/drop decisions and a compact first cut.
- 🎨 **Color grade** — candidate looks to review, then a baked LUT.
- 🎬 **B-roll** — reviewed visual cutaways from local media or Pexels.
- 💬 **Captions** — word-timed, preset styles with optional karaoke.
- 🃏 **Graphic motion cards** — titles, lower thirds, stats, quotes, and calls to action.
- 📱 **To TikTok/YouTube shorts** — extract moments and reframe them for 9:16 vertical.

## How It Works

Watch this 2-minute walkthrough to see how to interact with an AI coding agent and use cut-as-code skills to complete a video-editing workflow.

## Demos

### 1. 2h video to TikTok/YouTube shorts

> **Prompt:** For [video-path], use /video-understand, /video-to-shorts, /video-add-captions, and /video-add-content-cards.
>
> **Agent:** Proposes short-form candidates, and displays captions and content cards with graphic motion for your review, and delivers the final edit.

### 2. Cut, caption & add graphics to a raw interview

> **Prompt:** For [video-path], use /video-understand, /video-cut, /video-add-captions, and /video-add-content-cards.
>
> **Agent:** Displays a few captions and content cards candidates for your review, then delivers the final edit.

### 3. Color grading

> **Prompt:** For [video-path], use /video-color-grade, and /video-edit-compare.
>
> **Agent:** Displays a few candidate grading options for your review, then do the final grading.

## Skills

Each directory under `skills/` is a self-contained agent skill. Its `SKILL.md` is both the agent playbook and the specification for that skill. 

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/video-understand` | Probe media, generate a word-level transcript, analyze speech, and build reusable evidence for downstream skills. |
| `/video-cut` | Create reviewed keep/drop decisions, generate the canonical timeline, render a compact first cut, and verify its boundaries. |
| `/video-color-grade` | Assess footage, generate named looks, review the alternatives, record a selection, and bake or apply a portable LUT. |
| `/video-add-b-roll` | Add selective transcript-timed visual cutaways from your own footage or Pexels, with reviewed candidates and recorded provenance. |
| `/video-add-captions` | Render preset-driven, word-timed captions with optional karaoke highlighting. |
| `/video-add-content-cards` | Add selective transcript-timed titles, lower thirds, statistics, lists, quotes, chapter cards, and calls to action. |
| `/video-to-shorts` | Find and extract approved horizontal shorts, then optionally create reviewed 9:16 vertical deliveries. |
| `/video-edit-compare` | Compare the original source with the actual final delivery on the original source clock. |

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the skills into your agent:

```bash
npx skills add WhiteTowerAI/cut-as-code
```

Or install them individually from ClawHub:

```bash
npm install -g clawhub
clawhub install @whitetowerai/<skill-name>
```

### Prompting

With a prompt, point your agent at a video and name the skills you want. For example:

> For [video-path], use /video-understand, /video-cut, /video-add-b-roll, /video-add-captions, and /video-add-content-cards.

### Note
- `/video-understand` is a **prerequisite** for `/video-cut`, `/video-to-shorts`,
`/video-add-captions`, and `/video-add-content-cards`. Run it first so downstream
skills share the same media metadata, transcript, analysis, and timeline.
- `/video-add-b-roll` needs a Pexels API key for stock footage. Put it in
`skills/video-add-b-roll/.env` as `PEXELS_API_KEY=<key>`.

```

Durable editing decisions and approval records must never live only in `work/cache/`.

- **`work/project.json`** is the shared manifest: available sequences, active operations and dependencies, operation status, integer revision numbers, `based_on` revision checks, review outputs, render contributions, and the final render path and status. Revision checks prevent an operation from silently rendering against stale upstream decisions.
- **`work/timeline.json`** is the canonical source-to-program mapping. Time values are in seconds and ranges are half-open `[start_s, end_s)`. The V1 model stays small and inspectable — chronological clips from one source with linear positive speed, no OpenTimelineIO required.

## Roadmap

Planned work — these items are not yet available.

- [ ] Make skills easier to install and update.
- [ ] Improve UI & UX design.
- [ ] Continue expanding the collection of composable video-editing skills.
