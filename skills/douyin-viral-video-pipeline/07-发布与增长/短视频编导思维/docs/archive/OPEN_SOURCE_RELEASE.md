## Do Not Publish In The First Release

- `outputs/`: generated internal validation artifacts.
- `internal/`: private beta notes, scorecards, creator distillation rules, and customer-test records.
- `iterations/`: internal pressure-test history.
- `README_internal_beta.md`: old internal beta narrative.
- `bifang_README_v2.6.md`: historical v2.6 usage note.
- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: only include if the V4 contest tooling is intentionally released.
- `tools/`: only include after rewriting the old contest audit scripts into open-source audits.
- `sales/`: only include after removing private pricing or sales-process context.
- Complex orchestration layers: hold back from V0.1 open source until internal validation, comparison, pilot, and pricing artifacts are removed.

## Remaining Before Public Release

- Choose and add a `LICENSE`.
- Keep V0.2-rc open source skills-only; decide later whether a cleaned orchestration layer should be released.
- Replace contest-specific package audit with an open-source audit.
- Run the smoke cases on at least three real industries: local store, high-ticket service, and course/IP.
- Review all non-skill docs for old wording such as "爆款引擎", hardcoded internal paths, and generated artifacts.
