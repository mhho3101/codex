"""The guards a mutation run showed could be removed with the suite still green.

A mutation audit deleted 67 guards one at a time and ran the whole suite after
each. Fifty went red. The seventeen that did not are the ones covered here and
in `test_simple_lifecycle`: each was live code whose removal changed real
behaviour, and no test noticed.

The point of this module is not coverage in the line-counting sense. Each test
below was written against a specific mutation and confirmed to fail when that
mutation is reapplied -- a test that stays green under the break it names is
worth nothing, which is the whole finding this module answers.
