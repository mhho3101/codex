"""Semantic references must name something that is actually there.

A reference that names a real file can still point at nothing: ``field`` can
name a key the target record does not carry, ``projected_fields`` can name a
contract field that was removed, and ``source_step_pointer`` can name a causal
step that no longer exists. None of that is caught by checking that the
*artifact* exists, which is all the reference resolver does.

This is not hypothetical. Shrinking the episode map removed the single-step
``causal_escalation`` field and left eight episode cards pointing at
``/causal_escalation/0``. Every existing test stayed green; the dangling
pointers were found by reading. This module is the test that would have caught
them.

It runs over the golden project because that is the one complete, fully
resolvable project in the repository. Templates point at ``剧集/<EP>/...``
placeholders that resolve to nothing by design, so they are out of scope here.

    A file may hold more than one record type (a screenplay index opens with a

    Limitation worth knowing: a foreign key that happens to be unique *and*
