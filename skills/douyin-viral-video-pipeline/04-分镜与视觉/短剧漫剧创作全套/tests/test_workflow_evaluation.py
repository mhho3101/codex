"""The main-workflow evaluation: one real novel, run end to end, checked here.

`evaluations/让你管账号/reference-run` is the recorded output of the documented
workflow against a 147 KB novel. Why it exists alongside `examples/` -- and what
it deliberately carries that the hand-shaped samples do not -- is in
`evaluations/README.md`; this module is the gate that holds it to that bar.

It asserts that the checkers still pass and that the derived layers still
reproduce from their sources. Whether the episode is any good as drama is a
creative review, and the procedure for that is in the same README.
