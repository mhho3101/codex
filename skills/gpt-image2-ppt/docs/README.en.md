# gpt-image2-ppt-skills

**Generate design-forward, highly polished PPT decks with OpenAI `gpt-image-2` in one shot.**

Works natively in Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, and any other Skill-compatible agent. Once installed in your agent, a single natural-language prompt yields 16:9 high-res images + a ready-to-send `.pptx` — or clones any reference `.pptx` template and reskins it with new content.

Instead of filling text into traditional templates, it uses the visual taste, composition, and layout strengths of `gpt-image-2` to generate each slide as a complete visual composition, aiming for decks that look polished, consistent, and presentation-ready from cover to inner pages.

The project also includes dedicated optimization for editing image-based PPTs. The normal workflow keeps each complete visual composition as a full-slide image. When native PowerPoint objects are explicitly required, an **opt-in editable mode** can reconstruct known text, basic shapes, connectors, and complex visuals as separate objects. This mode is off by default.

## 🧩 Opt-in editable mode example

Editable mode still lets `gpt-image-2` create the complete art-directed slide first. A post-generation scene then reconstructs text and basic graphics as native PowerPoint objects while keeping complex artwork as independent image layers.

<table>
<tr><th width="50%">Original complete visual</th><th width="50%">Office render of editable PPTX</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../examples/editable-pptx/case05-summer-poster/original.png" width="100%" alt="editable example original"></td>
<td><img src="../examples/editable-pptx/case05-summer-poster/rendered.png" width="100%" alt="editable example rendered"></td>
</tr>
</table>

The PPTX contains **13 selectable objects**: 5 native text boxes, 6 native shapes, 1 clean plate, and 1 movable and resizable mascot-and-ice-cream image layer. Text and basic graphics remain directly editable in PowerPoint, while the complex hero artwork preserves the full `gpt-image-2` visual quality.

- [Download the editable Case 05 PPTX](../examples/editable-pptx/case05-summer-poster/editable.pptx)
- [View the complete Case 05 study: source visual, separated layer, edge checks, and quality report](../examples/editable-pptx/case05-summer-poster/)

When you need an editable deliverable, you can ask:

> Create this deck in editable mode. Keep text and basic graphics directly editable in PowerPoint, make the complex hero visual independently movable, and preserve as much of the complete `gpt-image-2` art direction as possible.

Object-level reconstruction is used only when the user explicitly asks for editable text, separable elements, movable artwork, or similar requirements. Otherwise, the default image-first workflow continues to prioritize the strongest visual result.

> ⚠️ **Editable mode requires a working local PPTX renderer.** Just like template-clone mode, it needs executable Windows PowerPoint, macOS Keynote, or LibreOffice. Users do not need to run a check command; they only need to describe the editable deliverable in natural language as shown above. The Skill checks the environment automatically, then renders the finished `-editable.pptx` to `editable_renders/page-XX.png` for page-by-page visual review by a multimodal agent. Without a usable renderer, an unreviewed editable file is not reported as a successful deliverable.

Editable reconstruction is **quality-first with controlled generation rounds**. Low-cost preflight checks and render reviews may run repeatedly. The workflow first uses deterministic fixes such as font, coordinate, crop, and layering changes; then original-pixel extraction and occlusion completion; then AI regeneration only for failed complex layers. A full-slide regeneration is reserved for structural composition failures.

## 🚀 Quick start

### 1. Ask your AI assistant to install the Skill

Send this to Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Trae, Hermes Agent, or another Skill-compatible assistant:

> Please install gpt-image2-ppt-skills:<br>
> https://github.com/JuneYaooo/gpt-image2-ppt-skills

The assistant installs it for the current environment and tells you when to restart.

### 2. Describe the deck you want

**Generate a new deck**

> Make a 6-slide deck about “How AI changes content creation.” Show me one cover first, and use a refined high-tech visual direction.

**Follow a template**

> I uploaded `company-template.pptx`. Follow its layout, palette, and visual language to make an 8-slide deck about our annual product strategy.

If you do not already have a template, browse [SlideCraft Template Gallery](https://slidecraft-template-gallery.vercel.app), copy a template you like, and send the copied prompt directly to your AI assistant.

**Request an editable deliverable**

> Create this deck in editable mode. Keep text and basic graphics directly editable, make the complex hero visual independently movable, and preserve the complete `gpt-image-2` art direction.

The assistant organizes the content, confirms one visual sample, generates the full deck, and returns the images, PPTX, and output location.

## ✨ What it does

- 🎨 **Online template gallery** — browse all currently collected templates, search or filter by use case and style, then copy a template prompt directly into your AI assistant
- 🧬 **Template quality validation** — render cover, section, content, and data slides to check full-deck consistency, readability, and layout quality before a template is published
- 🧭 **Prompt Recipes** — `examples/` provides starter `slides_plan.md` templates for common scenarios such as product launches, investor pitches, weekly reports, courseware, thesis defenses, and book talks
- 🪄 **Template-clone mode** — drop in any `.pptx`; the agent follows its layout, palette, and illustration language, then swaps in your new content
- 🎯 **Precise natural-language edits** — say "change slide 3's subtitle", "remove the footer", or "replace these three metrics"; the agent regenerates only the target slide through image-to-image editing while trying to preserve the original style and layout
- 🎮 **Dual output** — high-res PNG per slide + 16:9 `.pptx` ready to use
- ⚡ **10-way concurrency by default** — a 10-page deck finishes in ~30s
- 🧪 **Preview one slide first** — approve the cover before generating the full deck
- 🧾 **Trackable edits** — changed slides and generated versions can be traced and rolled back
- 🧩 **Opt-in editable output** — explicitly requested decks can use native text, shapes, connectors, and independent picture layers

## ✅ Best-fit use cases

| Use case | Fit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate a new deck from a topic | Strong | Good for reports, pitches, training, courses, product intros. |
| Create a new deck from a company template | Strong | Provide a `.pptx`, approve one cover first, then run the full deck. |
| Edit titles, subtitles, dates, footers | Strong | The most stable editing scenario. |
| Update metric cards and key numbers | Good | Works, but every number must be checked before delivery. |
| Modify only one slide in a multi-slide deck | Good | The target slide is regenerated; other slides are left alone. |
| Dense tables, financial reports, legal long copy | Weak | Small text and numbers need strict human review. |

If the user only has a rough topic and no complete outline yet, the agent can first consult [`examples/`](../examples/) to draft a scenario-appropriate `slides_plan.md`, ask for confirmation, then convert it to `slides_plan.json` and continue with generation.

## 🎨 Online template gallery

All currently collected templates are presented in [SlideCraft Template Gallery](https://slidecraft-template-gallery.vercel.app). Search or filter by use case and visual style, review real generated outputs, then copy the prompt from any template and send it directly to Codex, Claude Code, or another AI assistant.

[![SlideCraft Template Gallery — browse and copy presentation templates](assets/template-gallery-en.jpg)](https://slidecraft-template-gallery.vercel.app)

Open any template to preview the full slide set and copy either its template ID or complete prompt:

[![SlideCraft Template Gallery template detail — preview slides and copy the prompt](assets/template-gallery-detail-en.jpg)](https://slidecraft-template-gallery.vercel.app/templates/abstract-art-showcase)

> Click either image to open the corresponding page. New templates are added continuously, so this README no longer maintains a complete list that can quickly become outdated.

The gallery is evaluated as complete presentations rather than isolated cover images. New templates are tested across cover, section, content, and data slides and compared with the existing version. A published template is updated only when overall quality improves without a noticeable regression on key slides.

To use a gallery style, copy its prompt and send it to your AI assistant. To follow your own brand template, upload the `.pptx`, preview one slide first, and then generate the full deck.

## 🧪 Editing Capability Report

If you care about "how reliable are edits in real scenes", see the user-facing case report:

- **[`docs/edit_guide.md`](./edit_guide.md)** — title replacement, date edits, footer removal, metric updates, logo insertion, single-slide edits in a multi-slide deck, current limitations, and a delivery checklist

Summary:

| Capability | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Short text edits | Stable for everyday delivery. |
| Multiple explicit edits | Works best when the user clearly says what should stay unchanged. |
| Metric slides | Works, but numbers must be checked. |
| Small icon / logo insertion | Works for style-matched icons; real brand logos need source assets. |
| Native PowerPoint object editing | Default output uses full-slide images; opt-in editable mode emits native text, shapes, connectors, and independent picture layers. |

## 🛠 Manual install and advanced configuration

Most users should use the natural-language installation shown above. Use manual installation when you need to manage the repository and environment yourself:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JuneYaooo/gpt-image2-ppt-skills.git
cd gpt-image2-ppt-skills
bash install_as_skill.sh --target claude   # Claude Code
# or
bash install_as_skill.sh --target codex    # Codex
```

The script installs the skill into the selected agent directory:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/gpt-image2-ppt-skills/`
- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/gpt-image2-ppt-skills/`

<details>
<summary><strong>Direct API and secret configuration</strong></summary>

If you use direct API mode, inject environment variables through your agent
framework instead of writing secrets into the caller project's root `.env`:

- Claude Code: user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`, or project-level `.claude/settings.local.json`
- OpenClaw / custom agents: reference system env vars from `apiKey` / env config
- CI / servers: system env vars, Docker Compose, Kubernetes Secrets, or CI Secrets
- Standalone CLI: set `GPT_IMAGE2_PPT_ENV=/path/to/private.env`, or use the skill install directory `.env` as a fallback

```bash
# Variable names:
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com    # or any OpenAI-compatible relay
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                     # required
GPT_IMAGE_MODEL_NAME=gpt-image-2
GPT_IMAGE_QUALITY=high                    # low / medium / high / auto
```

> In **Codex**, if the current agent has native image generation, use the native path in `SKILL.md` and skip `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
>
> 🔒 **Won't accidentally eat your secrets**: the script only reads the current process env, platform-injected variables, an explicit `GPT_IMAGE2_PPT_ENV`, and the skill install directory `.env` fallback. It does **not** walk up into caller project directories.
>
> 🪄 Template-clone mode and editable mode both require an executable PPTX renderer such as Windows PowerPoint, macOS Keynote, or LibreOffice. Template cloning renders the source deck so the AI can inspect its layouts; editable mode renders the deliverable so the AI can visually review it. The Skill checks local support first and explains how to install a compatible renderer when unavailable. Template cloning may also use manually exported template-page images.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Vision analysis for template clone</strong></summary>

In template-clone mode, the skill needs to "see" your `.pptx` template's visual style first. **If your AI assistant is already multimodal** (Claude Code with Claude Opus/Sonnet, Codex with GPT multimodal, etc.), the agent will analyze the visual style directly and generate a `template_profile.json` with `reference_image` to pass to the CLI with `--template-profile`. **No extra configuration needed.**

Only when your agent uses a text-only model (e.g., DeepSeek text model), you'll need the following env vars to use a separate multimodal model for template analysis:

```bash
# Optional: vision analysis for template clone (only needed by text-only agents; skip for multimodal agents)
VISION_BASE_URL=https://your-openai-compatible-relay.example.com/v1
VISION_API_KEY=sk-...
VISION_MODEL_NAME=gemini-3.1-pro-preview   # or gpt-4o / claude-3.5-sonnet, any multimodal SKU
```

> Supports any multimodal model compatible with the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format (Gemini / GPT-4o / Claude, etc.). Fully decoupled from `gpt-image-2` — switching the vision provider won't affect image generation.

</details>

## 🆕 Changelog

- **2026-08-02 · 233 new PPT templates** — Added 197 Morandi-style, 26 punk-style, and 10 tech-style templates under `styles/xiamulingzi/`, expanding the library from 32 to 265 templates.
- **2026-08-01 · Template cloning, distillation, and online gallery upgrade** — Unified template reuse and added multi-slide visual checks, old/new comparisons, and failure protection. Current templates are also presented in SlideCraft Template Gallery with search, filters, real output previews, and copy-ready prompts for AI assistants.
- **2026-07-13 · Editable render-back and iteration policy** — `--editable` now requires a working PowerPoint, Keynote, or LibreOffice renderer, automatically emits `editable_renders/page-XX.png` for multimodal review, and uses a quality-first escalation policy with repeated low-cost checks and targeted repairs before any full-slide regeneration.
- **2026-07-11 · Editable mode** — Explicit editable-delivery requests can reconstruct complete visual masters as native text, shapes, connectors, and independent image layers. Overlapping assets follow the A1 original-pixel extraction → A2 occlusion completion → B AI separation/regeneration route. Default behavior is unchanged.
- **2026-05-31 · Two modes for real assets** — Product screenshots, logos, charts, tables, medical images, and evidence screenshots are preserved as independent source-image objects by default; users can explicitly allow reference-based redraws.
- **2026-05-26 · Expanded style library** — Added 22 selected styles covering business, academic, education, food, fashion, healthcare, and sustainability presentations.
